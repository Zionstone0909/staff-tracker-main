# npm resolution error report

While resolving: staff-tracker-main@0.0.0
Found: react@undefined
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@">=18" from react-router-dom@7.9.6
node_modules/react-router-dom
  react-router-dom@"7.9.6" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
